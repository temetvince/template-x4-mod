# X4 Mod Template
A template for new X4 mods

**Important!** This assumes you have extracted the X4 cat files to C:\X4

## Instructions:
* Run *webserver.bat* to view jobs.html or scriptproperties.html. Requires Python 3.
* Autocomplete in Visual Studio Code requires installing the *XML Language Support by Red Hat* extension.
* Rename all instances of *mod_name* to the name of your mod.
* If you're not using aiscripts or mdscripts, then remove the appropriate folder inside *mod_name/* before shipping your mod.
* Keep all file names lowercase to ensure compatibility with Linux and Mac.
