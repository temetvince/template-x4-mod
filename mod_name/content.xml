<!-- <content> is the main tag of content.xml. Its attributes give basic information about your mod. All attributes are optional!
    id:      must be unique among all installed mods. A good way to ensure this is a system like yourAlias_ModName.
    name:    The display name of the mod_id. If this tag is omitted, the mods folder name will be used.
    author:  Your name or alias.
    version: is the mod version. Versions always have two decimal points. So version="110" is displayed as 1.10 
    date:    should be the release date of the version 
    save:    If set to "true" or "1", the mod is saved in the savegame. If set to "false" or "0", the mod is not saved in the savegame.
    enabled: If set to "true" or "1", the mod is enabled by default.
    description: Is the description text for your mod.
                Special characters must be noted as numeric character references. E.g. a linebreak (\n\r) is denoted as &#13;&#10; -->
